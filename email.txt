Subject: Concern about work conflicting with life

Hello sir,
I am very greatful that perennial system gave me such oppurtunity to work with and it indeed boosted up my career prgress.
The environment that company provides is so workful that I hardly say no to any challenge and colleagues are always up to support.

But I am sorry to tell you this that with my all heart into the work, it is conflicting with my personal life and not able to give time to things which i thought should also be my priorities like hobby, friends and family.
So I am requesting you to please reduce some workload on my end, not because I lack technical skills but because I should also give some time to my personal space otherwise if unattended, it can effect my productivity

Thank you for listening to me, I hope you will take valid action soon.

Warm regards
Yogesh Kumar
